# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 15, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Continued MERN Stack Tutorial by [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBTYxXADG_k&list=PLillGF-RfqbbiTGgA77tGO426V3hRF9iE)

**Thoughts:** This is my 2nd tutorial on Redux and I am starting to become comfortable with all the boilerplate that Redux needs to get going. Actions and reducers are starting to make sense. :)

### Day 1: March 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Created a new page design for a client site built with Shopify. Created custom template in Liquid, the templating language.

**Thoughts:** Since the start of this project, I have become so much more comfortable with Liquid and my ability to create custom snippets and templates within Shopify

### Day 2: March 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished MERN Stack Tutorial by Traversy Media.

**Thoughts:** It was really cool to see my progress and the new updates to the MERN site with user auth. Feel like 1 more MERN Stack tutorial and I will become very comfortable with building my own projects

### Day 3: March 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on custom Gutenberg Blocks for a freelance client.

**Thoughts:** I enjoyed getting back to Wordpress for the first time since the major update with Gutenberg blocks. I have a lot to learn to building in Wordpress in 2019

### Day 4: March 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I continued working on BienVita's site with some small responsive edits. Also, I started a website for my friend's company, JOLT.

**Thoughts:** I am building Jolt's new site wit Gatsby JS so that they have a fast site and I can master Gatsby.

### Day 5: March 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Only worked on getting an image on the Jolt Nav bar component in Gatsby

**Thoughts:** MY THOUGHTS ARE: IT IS WAY TOO HARD TO USE AN IMAGE IN GATSBY WITH SO MANY OPTIONS!

### Day 6: March 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Began styling and adding more components to landing page to give more information about the platform.

**Thoughts:** I almost had a lazy day and got nothing done, but thankfully [David Goggins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvWB7B8tXK8) inspired me to go on a run and then get back to coding today!
