# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 15, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Continued MERN Stack Tutorial by [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBTYxXADG_k&list=PLillGF-RfqbbiTGgA77tGO426V3hRF9iE)

**Thoughts:** This is my 2nd tutorial on Redux and I am starting to become comfortable with all the boilerplate that Redux needs to get going. Actions and reducers are starting to make sense. :)

### Day 1: March 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Created a new page design for a client site built with Shopify. Created custom template in Liquid, the templating language.

**Thoughts:** Since the start of this project, I have become so much more comfortable with Liquid and my ability to create custom snippets and templates within Shopify
